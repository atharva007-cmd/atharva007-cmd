Hi, I'm Atharva Marathe, currently enrolled as a senior pursuing an undergraduate degree in CSE. When I'm not coding, yelling "It worked !!" or swearing at computer, you'll find me cooking, reading or working out.
<br><br>

## About me
I'm curious about things and enjoy learning. I love to explore new domains and territories and don't fixate myself to any certain technology. That's why it's easy to adapt and learn new things with strong basics foundation.
